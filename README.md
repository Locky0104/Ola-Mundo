Hey humans, my name is Bruno and I came in peace.
I'm cool, and I hate studying in USA
I'm here for 3 reasons:
  1-Learn how to programm
  2-Do something cool at school (programming) so the time passes faster.
  3-When I finish I'll have a game and I hope I can play at school to make time pass faster.
